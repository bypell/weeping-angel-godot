# weeping-angel-godot
 
Simple demo project for godot 4.2.
The statue uses a VisibleOnScreenNotifier3D (checks if statue is inside player's view frustum by default) and some RayCast nodes (checks for occlusion) to check if it's visible to the player.

3d statue model used: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/franz-von-assisi-f05c2d9c0af5430b9b72b9d170b4dcca
